# 🌳 Tree Species Classification – AI Project by Arjun m v

This is a machine learning project that classifies tree species based on:
- 📷 Tree images (using a CNN model)
- 📍 Location & attributes (using a KNN recommender)

I received the base code from a peer for learning purposes and have customized, tested, and prepared it for my submission.

## 🧠 Features

1. **Tree Recommender by Location** (KNN)
2. **Image Classifier for Tree Species** (CNN)
3. **Streamlit-based Web App**

## 🚀 How to Run

After placing all model files in the same folder, run:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_integrated.py
```
